		<ul>
			<li>All design elements, code, hardware builds, etc. for your project must be created during the event. Third party tools and frameworks are allowed as 
	   well as your normal tooling (Gulp, Yeoman, Composer, NPM, Bower, etc.). While you may not begin coding in advance, you can plan and discuss with your team in 
	   advance. Written documents and design sketches are allowed.  You may also incorporate pre-existing material that is freely available to the public into your 
	   project, such as public domain images, Creative Commons music, open-source libraries, existing APIs and platforms, and the like.</li><br>
			<li>Teams must be comprised of 1-4 people.</li><br>
			<li>Only ten of the competing teams will present their projects in the final round of judging at the end of the event.The presenting teams will be determined
			by an initial round of judging that will take place during the final 1.5 hours of the event.  Note: we recommend that, prior to the beginning of preliminary
			judging, teams prepare a short (~2 minute) project pitch to be given to a subset of the judges.</li><br>

					<br><li>Less than two years of serious coding experience (Education is excluded from this)</li>
